# 🛰️ KṣhetraNetra – Bidirectional Satellite Monitoring System

**KṣhetraNetra** is an AI-powered satellite monitoring application designed to detect structural and vegetation changes in sensitive regions such as border zones, nuclear sites, and abandoned military areas.

It performs **bidirectional change detection** — identifying both the **appearance of new structures** and the **disappearance of existing ones** — using NDVI and NDBI analysis over user-defined Areas of Interest (AOIs). The system also generates real-time alerts and visual reports.

## 🔧 Features

- 🗺️ AOI selection via interactive map
- 🌱 NDVI/NDBI-based vegetation and built-up analysis
- 📷 Before–after satellite image comparison
- 🔍 Detection of both new and removed structures
- ⚠️ Real-time alert and visual reporting
- 📊 Streamlit-based web dashboard
